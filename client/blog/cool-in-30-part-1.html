		<h1>How to Make S*** Look Cool in 30 seconds</h1>
		<p>This is a series aimed at developers who have little knowledge of design principles, but want to add a little extra pizazz to their sites. The tips given are based off of current web design trends and should make anyone who looks at your site go "Holy F*** you've got style"</p>

		<p>In this first entry in the "How to Make S*** Look Cool in 30 seconds" series, we are going to talk about full-bleed, blurred background images. This technique is so hot in web design right now, and is a super simple way to make your project look snappy.</p>

		<h2>How to do it:</h2>
		<p>You'll need a few things: an html file, a css file, and an image. That's it! The image can be whatever you want, it can be something that relates to the project you're working on, or you can just pull a random image to use. Here are some nice royalty free sites you can take images from:</p>

		</ul>

		<h3>The HTML</h3>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;This S*** Looks Hot&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;div class="blurred-background"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
		</pre>

		<h3>The CSS</h3>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
h1 {
	font-family: 'Courier New', sans-serif;
	text-align: center;
	margin-top: 50px;
	font-size: 60px;
}
.blurred-background {
	background: url('http://i.imgur.com/CJnnTiT.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
	background-size: cover;
	-webkit-background-size: cover;
	-moz-background-size: cover;
	-o-background-size: cover;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	z-index: -1;
}
		</pre>

		<h3>The Result</h3>
		<iframe src="demo/full-bleed-demo.html"></iframe>

		<p>Boom, you're done, and your site looks amazing.</p>

		<h2>ADVANCED STEPS</h2>
		<p>If you want to get real creative, you could use this technique not just as a background to the entire page, but as a background to a specific section.</p>

		<img src="Example image" />

		<p>A few slight tweaks need to be made to the CSS, but it's nothing major.</p>
