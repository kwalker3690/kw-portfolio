		<p>In this first entry in the "How to Make S*** Look Cool in 30 seconds" series, we are going to talk about full-bleed, blurred background images. This technique is so hot in web design right now, and is a super simple way to make your project look snappy.</p>

		<h2>How to do it:</h2>
		<p>You'll need a few things: an html file, a css file, and an image. That's it! The image can be whatever you want, it can be something that relates to the project you're working on, or you can just pull a random image to use. Here are some nice royalty free sites you can take images from:</p>
