		<p>I built this Angular/Node app over a two day solo hackathon at Hack Reactor. This was one of my first experiences working with an external Javascript API, the New York Times API. Every time a user searches for a topic, the NYT API is queried and the results are displayed in a visual manner using the resulting images.</p>
