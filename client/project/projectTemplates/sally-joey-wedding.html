		[SCREENSHOT ON A COMPUTER]
		<p>I designed and implemented the website for my friends' wedding from the ground up. This was a chance for me to just totally have fun with visual design, so I decided to create one long scrolling page with parallax background images. Itâ€™s built with HTML, SASS, and Javascript.</p>

		<p>I was very unfamiliar with Javascript when I began this project, so I used this opportunity to increase knowledge by integrating with some JS libraries. I worked with Skrollr to create the parallax effect. The links are scrolled to from the nav with a Jquery script.</p>

		[SCREENSHOT OF DESIGN ELEMENTS]
		<p>The visual design incorporates some classic elements like swirling web fonts, but gets modernized by flat buttons with condensed font and a little trendy parallax. The large images highlight the beauty of the couple, what the site is all about!</p>

		[SCREENSHOT OF MOBILE LAYOUT]
		<p>This website would be sent out to invitees on a paper invitation as well as through an email. I figured that it was likely that some people would open the site on their mobile phones, so I implemented this site with a responsive layout.</p>
