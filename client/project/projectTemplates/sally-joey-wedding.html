		<p>Earlier this year I designed and implemented the website for my friend’s wedding. This was a chance for me to just totally have fun with visual design, so I decided to create one long scrolling page with parallax background images. This allowed me to work on my javascript skills, incorporating and manipulating some javascript plugins and libraries. The visual design incorporates some classic wedding site elements like swirling web fonts, but gets modernized by flat buttons and a little trendy parallax. It’s built with hand coded HTML, SASS, and javascript plugins.</p>
