			<h1>Migrating Expert and Student Consult Users to Inkling</h1>
			<p>Problem: Over 1 million users needed to be smoothly transferred from the previous Expert and Student Consult websites to the Inkling platform.</p>
			<p>Solution: A clean migration flow that took users from their email into their library with their books transferred seamlessly.</p>
			[IMAGE OF FLOW]
			<p>The initial migration of [LINK TO EC WHITELABEL]Expert Consult and Student Consult users to Inkling meant bringing over 1 million users onto a new platform. As a product and development team, we wanted to make this as smooth of a transition for them as possible, leaving them with little to no questions about what was happening to them, their accounts, and their eBooks.</p>
			<p>After many brainstorming sessions on how to go about this, we decided upon sending an email out to all of the existing users with a link to set their password. Then we needed to send them to a page where they set their password for their account. From there we took them to their library, from where they could read their books on the web or download a native app to read.</p>

			[IMAGE OF DRAFTS OF SET PASSWORD PAGE]
			<p>The set password page was a page of great importance. A lot of users could drop off here if we didn’t make it clear to them what was happening or if they lost trust in us.</p>
			<p>We wanted to make it very clear to the users that their entire library had been transferred over to this new platform, and that they had not lost any books.</p>
			<p>We also wanted to get across why they had to go through this process, what they would be getting out of it by having their books on Inkling, for example, the interactivity, mobile access, etc.</p>
			<p>Above are some of the explorations I did of this specific migration page, balancing getting users through the migration flow by setting their password with explaining what was going on.</p>
			<p>I had some sample users compare these different layouts. The users tended to respond better to the more simplified layouts, citing that they would want to get through this page so that they could explore their books once they got out the other side. They overwhelmingly felt that this was not a stage where they needed to learn about Inkling, but instead wanted to complete the task at hand and not be distracted. </p>

			[IMAGE OF MIGRATION PAGE]
			<p>Above is the final result after multiple iterations. This page is simple, but still holds a few very refined key elements. On the left, there is a large explanatory statement of what is happening, underneath the user’s name, which instills trust. Then we explain that the eBooks they had before will be available on this site. They are also provided with the option to go to our features page if they'd like to find out more about our platform. On the right, there is a very simplified form. The user’s email is bolded at the top, connecting them to the email that they just came from. After filling out a new password they are taken to their library, where their books are waiting, as well as a welcome message that explains more about our native apps and our other features.</p>
			<p>This turned out to be a very successful flow, our support tickets did not spike dramatically and we were able to migrate a large portion of their users in the first few days this email was sent out.</p>
			<p>We were also aware that many of our new users would never look at the email we sent to them to prompt this flow. To make up this, we implemented various other migration prompts for wherever the users were entering the site. When non-migrated users came to the new site they were met with messaging about the transition and were prompted to go through the migration flow.</p>
