			<h1>Whitelabeling the Inkling Store</h1>
			<p>Inkling partnered with Elsevier, a textbook company that has a large set of medical resources. Elsevier wanted Inkling to produce and sell textbooks for two of their products, Expert Consult and Student Consult.</p>

			<p>These two products were already existing websites where users could access PDF versions of their print books. Elsevier wanted to upgrade these users’ experience by bringing them over to the Inkling platform. However they wanted also to maintain a separate environment for these users, an Expert/Student consult that was powered by Inkling.</p>
			<p>The solution they concluded upon was to whitelabel our Inkling Store and reader.</p>
			<p>Using our Inkling Store code base, we set up separate instances at expertconsult.inkling.com and studentconsult.inkling.com. These all fed from the same front end and back end, with some minor changes to the code to enable what are essentially sibling sites.</p>
			<p>As a product designer, I was tasked to design these new sites. There were some major constraints placed on us based in the fact that they would rely on most of the same HTML and CSS as our site. So any major design changes to the store had to be considered across all three instances of the store.</p>

			<p>The very tricky part of this whole project was the initial migration, bringing over 1 million users onto a new platform. We wanted to make this as smooth of a transition for them as possible, leaving them with little to no questions about what was happening to them, their accounts, and their eBooks.</p>
			<p>Many ways to do this, and we thought through all of them. We decided upon sending an email out to all of the existing users with a link to set their password. Then we needed to send them to a page where they set their password for their account. From there we took them to their library, from where they could read their books on the web or download a native app to read.</p>

			<p>The set password page was a page of great importance. A lot of users could drop off here if we didn’t make it clear to them what was happening or if they lost trust in us.</p>
			<p>So we wanted to make it very clear to the users that their entire library had been transferred over to this new platform, and that they had not lost any books. </p>
			<p>We also wanted to get across why they had to go through this process, what they would be getting out of it by having their books on Inkling (ie the interactivity, mobile access, etc). </p>
			<p>So I did a lot of explorations of this specific migration page, balancing getting them through the migration flow by setting their password with explaining what was going on.</p>

			<p>Here is the final product for that specific page. After looking at some very complex options that had a lot of information about Inkling packed into the page, I decided that it was best to get the users through this page so that they could explore their books once they got out the other side. But this page still holds a few very refined key elements. On the left, there is a large explanatory statement of what is happening, underneath the user’s name, which instills trust. Then we explain that the eBooks they had before will be available on this site. Then we give them the option to go to our features page to find out more about our platform. On the right, there is a very simplified form. The user’s email is bolded at the top, connecting them to the email that they just came from. Then just a few actions takes them into their library, where their books are waiting, as well as a welcome message that explains more about our native apps and our other features.</p>
			<p>This turned out to be a very successful flow, our support tickets did not spike dramatically and we were able to migrate a large portion of their users in the first few days this email was sent out.</p>
			<p>There were also fail safe plans, as a lot of people do not look at these kind of emails. We implemented various other migration prompts for wherever the users were entering the site.</p>
