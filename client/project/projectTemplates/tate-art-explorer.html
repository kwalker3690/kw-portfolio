		<p>Tate Art Explorer provides a clean interface to discover new art. As you browse, you can like works of art to receive recommendations tailored to your preferences. This project was built over a week long period while I was a student at Hack Reactor. It is built using Node, Angular, a Neo4j graph database, and HTML/CSS.</p>
