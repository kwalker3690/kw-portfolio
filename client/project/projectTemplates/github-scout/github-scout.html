		<p>Github Scout allows you to view Github data at a glance. I worked the front-end development and design of this project over a two week period while I was a student at Hack Reactor. This site is built with Node, MySql, Angular, and Sass.</p>

			<p>Github Scout allows you to view graphs about individual user's activity on Github over time. We pull this data directly from the Github API upon performing a search. You can also compare two users against each other, and see the graphs automatically update. The graphs are built with <a href="http://nvd3.org/">NVD3</a>, a framework that integrates Angular and D3 beautifully.</p>

			<p>Individual languages can be graphed on Github Scout. These graphs are made by using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">Google Big Query</a> to pull data from <a href="http://www.githubarchive.org/">Github Archive.</a> You can also compare multiple languages against each other and again see the graphs automatically update.</p>
